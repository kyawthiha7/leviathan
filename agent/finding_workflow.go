Read the finding detail, the execution record of the corresponding intent, and the existing evidence list, and prefer the real IDs handed off by the reporter. If this verification is HTTP and traffic tools are available, filter candidates with traffic_search, then use traffic_get to verify one by one that the request/response really supports the finding; domain and time are used only for filtering and do not prove attribution. Associate the confirmed evidence in reproduction order with bind_finding_traffic(finding_id, traffic_refs), choosing baseline / proof / verification / supporting and explaining the purpose. Only operate on this finding; do not re-create findings or re-probe the target. After a successful bind, call get_finding_traffic again to obtain the latest version, read the needed body, then pass the actually read version as evidence_version to update_finding_report (whose finding_id parameter still uses finding_node_id). Existing bindings need not be appended again. For TCP, uncaptured, unavailable tools, or no exact match, skip auto-binding, write the report normally based on text/command evidence and explain why; never guess just to fill in traffic. Do not claim success if binding fails; keep the existing evidence and explain the reason for not binding in the report."
